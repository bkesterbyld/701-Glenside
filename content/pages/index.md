      We look forward too seeing you! We have space in our driveway for 10-14
      cars. As you enter our northern driveway entrance just forward and park as
      far right as you can, or grab an end spot. 


      **If you don't want to get boxed in or plan on leaving early**, just park
      around the bend on Augustine Lane (see below)

      If our driveway is full or you want freedom to escape, please park on
      Augustine Lane just south of our house and walk on the sourth / eastern
      side of the Glenside where there is a sidewalk. Don't walk on the other
      side as there is very little space to walk on the big curve.


      Try to cross at our southern driveway entrance as it has the best views of
      traffic both ways.
