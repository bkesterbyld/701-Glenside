      We look forward to seeing you! There is space in our driveway for 8-10
      cars. As you enter our northern driveway entrance (with the mailbox)
      please pull forward and park as far right as you can until all those spots
      are full. When those spots are gone, plese leave the left lane open for
      drop-offs, and park on Augustine Lane.

      Augustine Lane is near the big Glenside curve and is a 1-2 minute walk on
      the Southern sidewalk of Glenside. It may look like there is walking space
      across the street from Augustine, but residents planted stuff there long
      ago that makes it dangerous to navigate.


      When on foot to our house, cross at the first / southern driveway entrance
      as it has the best views of traffic both ways during the day. When leaving
      or at night, the other driveway has the better view.
