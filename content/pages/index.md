      We look forward too seeing you! There is space in our driveway 8-10 cars.
      As you enter our northern driveway entrance please pull forward and park
      as far right as you can until all those spots are full. When those spots
      are full please leave the left lane open for drop-off and park on
      Augustine Lane.

      Augustine Lane just around the big Glenside curve is a 1-2 minute walk on
      the Southern /  Eastern side of the Glenside where there is a sidewalk. It
      looks like there is walking space across from Augustine, but that's just
      city planning's sick sense of humor.


      When on foot to our house, try to cross at our southern driveway entrance
      as it has the best views of traffic both ways during the day. When
      leaving, the northern driveway has the better view.
